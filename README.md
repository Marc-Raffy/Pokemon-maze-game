# Pokemon-maze-game
A small project from my studies coded in Processing

This is a 2D game where you play Sasha the famous pokemon trainer. Your goal is to find the exit of a "maze". You start with fog of war around you and the way to remove it is to find the hidden pikachu in the level. The levels also feature ice which adds complexity to the game.
Along that you have a scoreboard and a level editor.

Known bugs: When you finish a level sometimes the pop-up asking you to enter your name (to keep track of the scores) appear behind the current window.
